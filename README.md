# Facemash Clone
How to make your own Facemash website.

## What is facemash? An example.
[Skinmash](skinmash.000webhostapp.com) is a website I created that works for [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/battle-pass/season-5) skins (Fortnite is a popular video game and skins are what a player may wear).  My spinoff of Facemash, dubbed Skinmash, behaves almost the exact same to the original Facemash website, which was programmed by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room as a prank.

His website asked users to choose who was "hotter" between two girls who attended Harvard.  On the backend, the website would rate the women using an algorithm called [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which is used to rate 1v1-based games such as chess or [football](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-elo-ratings-are-back/) and rank those respective players/teams.  The rankings would appear at the bottom.

An image of a clone of the original website can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/yigitbiber/pen/LpBfi/image/large.png).
